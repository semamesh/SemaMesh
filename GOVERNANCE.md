# SemaMesh Governance

SemaMesh is a Maintainer-led project. We aim to follow the best practices of the CNCF.

## Decision Making
Decisions regarding the project's direction, features, and releases are made by the Maintainers. We strive for consensus, but the Lead Maintainer has the final say in cases of disagreement.

## Adding Maintainers
New maintainers are added based on:
1. Sustained contribution (code, docs, or community support).
2. Alignment with project goals.
3. Nomination by an existing maintainer and a unanimous vote.

## Transparency
Technical discussions happen in GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
